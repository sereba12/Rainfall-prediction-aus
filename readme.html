<h1>Rainfall Prediction Project</h1>
<p>This project aims to predict next-day rainfall using classification models on the response variable <code>RainTomorrow</code>. The dataset includes around ten years of daily weather observations from various locations across Australia.</p>
<h2>Problem Scenario</h2>
<p>Predicting rainfall is crucial for better planning across various industries. Heavy and irregular rainfall can adversely affect crops, farms, and properties. Therefore, a reliable forecasting model is essential for putting preventative measures in place to mitigate risks to life and property.</p>
<h2>Problem Objective</h2>
<p>As a data analyst, your task is to predict the occurrence of rain the next day (<code>RainTomorrow</code>) using classification models. The project involves:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Feature engineering.
- Model building and validation.</p>
<h2>Data Description</h2>
<p>The data used in this project contains daily weather observations from several weather stations across Australia. You can find the dataset and further information on the Australian Bureau of Meteorology website: <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data">BOM Climate Data</a>.</p>
<h2>Project Structure</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>data</strong>: Contains raw and processed data.</li>
<li><strong>notebooks</strong>: Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, feature engineering, and model building.</li>

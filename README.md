# Rainfall Prediction Project

This project aims to predict next-day rainfall using classification models on the response variable `RainTomorrow`. The dataset includes around ten years of daily weather observations from various locations across Australia.

## Problem Scenario

Predicting rainfall is crucial for better planning across various industries. Heavy and irregular rainfall can adversely affect crops, farms, and properties. Therefore, a reliable forecasting model is essential for putting preventative measures in place to mitigate risks to life and property.

## Problem Objective

As a data analyst, your task is to predict the occurrence of rain the next day (`RainTomorrow`) using classification models. The project involves:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Feature engineering.
- Model building and validation.

## Data Description

The data used in this project contains daily weather observations from several weather stations across Australia. You can find the dataset and further information on the Australian Bureau of Meteorology website: [BOM Climate Data](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data).

## Project Structure

- **data**: Contains raw and processed data.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, feature engineering, and model building.
- **src**: Python scripts for various project tasks.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python packages.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed. Clone the repository and install the required packages using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rainfall-prediction.git
cd rainfall-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt


__## Usage__
Data Cleaning: Run the data_cleaning.ipynb notebook or data_cleaning.py script to clean the raw data.
Feature Engineering: Use the feature_engineering.ipynb notebook or feature_engineering.py script to create and select relevant features.
Model Building: Build and evaluate classification models using the model_building.ipynb notebook or model_building.py script.

__## Model Validation__
Plan a validation method to effectively evaluate the model, such as cross-validation or train-test split. Ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
